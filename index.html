      &nbsp; Hi There, This Is My Journey On How I Broke Into TECH
        </h1>

        <article>
        <p>
           Firstly, let me introduce myself. My name is <strong>Chinweike David Chinedu, </strong>I'm from Enugu state to be precise.
           <strong>Am a student at the National Open University Of Nigeria</strong> currently at my 200level, pursuing a Bachelors degree in Computer Science.
           Well i come from a family of four Boys, and i'm second on the list. And also am an Affiliate Marketer, that's basically how i survive  <br> Yeah that's all you need to know about me for now, let's get down to the reason you're reading this.
        </p>
    
           <h3> So this is how i became interested in the tech space.  </h3>
        <p>
            During 2023 in my secondary school days, i've always wanted to be a <strong>Software Developer</strong> and this all thanks to my father who made me see the light in tech.<br>
            With this revelation i decided to futher my education by studying Computer science, and that was the one of the best decisions i've made so far.<br>
            But as expected the Journey won't be easy. I faced numerous setbacks on the way which i'll list out.
            <ul>
                <li>My Laptop was so poor in the sence VS Code stopped working.</li>
                <li> Last year my phone was stolen and that was where i normally code, and i was phoneless for some months </li>
                <li> This resulted in me watching Youtube videos, but i wasn't implementing what i was learning.</li>
                <li> For some reason i stopped codding.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            At that point i began to doubt myself and my chioces. But everything changed this year.<br>
             When i heard about the Enugu Tech Fest, i was excited and i said to myself &nbsp; <em>finally i can get to hear from expacts in the tech ecosystem. </em><br>
             And it was amazing, because it ignited that passion in me again. And that's how i got to know about <strong>Genesys Tech Hub,</strong> and to be honest am loving the experience and exposure to the amazing stuffs am learning as a <em>Web Developer Inter.</em> <br><br>
             Well that's the <strong>end for now,</strong> can't wait to see what the future holds after this training.
        </p>
